## FIRST Robotics

### Team 5823 ACE
In 2015, I had the privilege of founding Team 5823, a high school robotics team that, to my delight, expanded to include over 50 enthusiastic members during my tenure as captain from 2015 to 2018. Our journey was full of learning experiences, with one of the highlights being an unexpected feature on Chinese national television. To our astonishment, we emerged victorious in the International Division of the 2015 China Robotics Challenge. Encouraged by this accomplishment, we continued to participate and were honored with a win in the National Division in 2016.

### Team 7529 Mulan
In 2018, I had the unique opportunity to co-found Team Mulan, the first all-girl robotics team in mainland China. As one of the mentors from 2018 to 2019, it was deeply rewarding to witness the team grow, attracting over 50 dedicated members. The journey wasn't without its challenges, but with concerted efforts, we managed to secure over 30,000 USD in sponsorships to support our endeavors. The creation of Team Mulan was driven not by a desire for accolades, but by a vision to encourage more girls in China to explore the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and Robotics. At that time, these fields were largely dominated by male participants in China, and we believed in the importance of challenging this status quo. It's been an honor to play a part in inspiring and empowering these young women to pursue their interests and make their marks in the robotics arena.

### Team 7594 Nautilus
In 2019, seeing a need for more engineering exposure at my high school, I founded Team Nautilus, a robotics team with the mission of introducing younger students to the exciting world of engineering. Having the opportunity to mentor Team Nautilus from 2019 to 2020 was an immensely gratifying experience. It was a joy to share my passion for this field and to see these young individuals develop an interest of their own. Our efforts bore fruit beyond cultivating an interest in engineering among the students: our team was honored with the Highest Rookie Seed Award and the Rookie Inspiration Award at the Finger Lakes Regional. However, the real reward lay in seeing the sparks of curiosity ignite in the students, and knowing we had given them a valuable introduction to a field that had inspired me so deeply.

<!-- ## Writing

### Personal Writing
As a writer, I've been fortunate to have had the opportunity to express my thoughts on important issues, particularly those related to STEM education and societal matters. Over time, this journey has resulted in the publication of more than 300 essays across 65 newspapers and magazines, an achievement that still surprises me. To my astonishment, 8 magazines even saw fit to launch personal special editions featuring my work, an honor I deeply appreciate. Perhaps one of the most humbling recognitions was being listed among the Top 10 Youth Writers in China for the Yuhua Cup. While these accolades are heartening, the true reward has always been the chance to contribute to conversations that I believe are crucial and to hopefully inspire others to engage in these important discussions.

### Publication
Beyond the realm of magazines and newspapers, I was privileged enough to venture into the world of book publishing. My essay collection, "No Game, No Life," was published and saw a print run of 5,000 copies, thanks to the support of the National Literature and History Press. Later, I had the opportunity to delve into the realm of speculative fiction, resulting in the publication of my science fiction collection, "Destination: Light & Warmth," which reached an even wider audience with 6,000 copies, thanks to National United Press. Seeing these works reach so many readers has been deeply humbling and I am grateful for the opportunity to share my perspectives on a larger scale.

### Recognition
I've been fortunate enough to receive recognition for my work, with over 20 national awards that I regard as a testament to the power of persistent effort rather than personal prowess. Among these, winning the 17th China Juvenile Writer Writing Competition, the 4th China Youth Writer Writing Competition, and the 9th National Bingxin Youth Writer Writing Competition stand out as particularly humbling experiences. Each award serves as a reminder of the impact that words can have, and of the responsibility to use that impact wisely.  -->
